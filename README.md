## üß† Overview

**JARVIS** ("Just A Rather Very Intelligent System") is an AI assistant designed for natural, context-aware conversations. Built with a desi, tech-savvy vibe, JARVIS leverages advanced memory and NLP to store and recall user preferences, goals, and facts, responding with a mix of English and Hinglish for a relatable, engaging experience. The `conversation.py` module powers JARVIS‚Äôs core conversational capabilities.

## üåü Conversational Features

JARVIS offers a robust set of conversational features, enabling personalized and context-aware interactions:

| **Feature**                       | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Personalized Responses**        | Tailors replies using user profile data (e.g., name, preferences).             |
| **Context Awareness**             | Incorporates time, location, and past interactions for relevant responses.     |
| **Memory System**                 | Stores and retrieves user facts, preferences, goals, and mood history.         |
| **Vector Embeddings**             | Uses Cohere embeddings for similarity-based context retrieval.                 |
| **Hinglish Tone**                 | Combines English and Hindi for a friendly, desi conversational style.          |
| **Predefined Responses**          | Provides quick replies for common queries (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the time?‚Äù).          |
| **Proactive Suggestions**         | Offers reminders or actions based on user goals (e.g., task suggestions).      |
| **Emotional Intelligence**        | Adjusts tone based on detected user mood for empathetic interactions.          |
| **Error Handling**                | Gracefully manages API errors and speech output failures.                      |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Core Components
- **AdvancedVectorMemory**:
  - Stores user data (facts, preferences, goals, mood) in JSON files (`vectors.json`, `messages.json`, `user_profile.json`, `embedding_cache.json`).
  - Uses Cohere‚Äôs `embed-english-v3.0` for vector embeddings and similarity-based context retrieval.
  - Categorizes messages (e.g., preference, fact, goal) using Cohere‚Äôs `command-r-plus`.
  - Prunes outdated or low-confidence data (30-day limit or confidence > 0.7).
  - Generates proactive suggestions based on recent or high-confidence user data.
- **JarvisAI**:
  - Manages user interactions via text or voice input.
  - Processes queries with Cohere‚Äôs `command-r-plus` for general responses.
  - Handles predefined responses for common queries (e.g., time, date).
  - Supports memory commands (e.g., ‚Äúremember‚Äù, ‚Äúforget‚Äù) for user data management.
  - Limits chat history to 21 messages for efficient memory usage.

### Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**: `cohere`, `requests`, `numpy`, `asyncio`, `json`, `dotenv`, `hashlib`, `logging`, `collections.Counter`.
- **External APIs**:
  - Cohere: `embed-english-v3.0` (embeddings), `command-r-plus` (text generation).
- **Custom Modules**: `voice.tts` for text-to-speech output.

### Technical Highlights
- **Embedding-Based Memory**: Combines Cohere embeddings, tag overlap, and relevance scores for precise context retrieval.
- **Dynamic Context**: Integrates time, location, and user profile for tailored responses.
- **Efficient Storage**: Caches embeddings and prunes old data to optimize performance.
- **Robust Logging**: Tracks errors for debugging and reliability.

---

## üîç How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: Accepts text or voice input (voice requires additional setup).
2. **Context Retrieval**: Fetches relevant user data using vector embeddings and tags.
3. **Query Handling**: Matches queries to predefined responses or processes them via Cohere‚Äôs NLP.
4. **Response Generation**: Delivers personalized replies via text and voice in a Hinglish tone.
5. **Memory Management**: Stores significant user data (e.g., preferences, goals) and prunes outdated entries.

---

## üìù Notes
- JARVIS is in development, with some features (e.g., automation commands, GUI integration) not yet implemented in `conversation.py`.
- The system focuses on conversational logic, with voice output partially implemented via `voice.tts`.
