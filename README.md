## 🧠 What is JARVIS?

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fully customizable AI assistant for Windows.  
It can:
- Understand natural voice commands using powerful NLP (via Cohere Command R+)
- Automate apps (open/close software)
- Perform smart file searches (AI-enhanced)
- Control AC appliances (Arduino + Optocoupler based)
- Interact with GUI and camera
- Respond with human-like speech
- And more...

Designed to behave like Tony Stark’s assistant – minus the sarcasm. 😉
