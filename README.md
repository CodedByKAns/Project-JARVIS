## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

JARVIS is built on a modular, scalable architecture to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and performance. Below is an overview of its core components and workflow.

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Components
1. **Speech Recognizer**: Captures voice input and converts it to text using `SpeechRecognition`.
2. **NLP Engine**: Interprets user intent with Cohere Command R+ for online processing and a lightweight local model for offline tasks.
3. **Intent Detector**: Maps interpreted commands to specific actions (e.g., file search, app launch, or hardware control).
4. **Execution Modules**: Handle tasks like automation, file indexing, or vision processing.
5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts responses to natural-sounding speech using `edge_tts` or cloud-based TTS APIs.
6. **OS Interface**: Interacts with Windows APIs for automation via `pywin32` and `pyautogui`.
7. **Computer Vision Module**: Processes visual data screen llama-3-2-11b for real-time analysis.
8. **Hardware Interface**: Communicates with Arduino for appliance control using `pySerial`.

```

### üîÑ Data Flow
1. Voice input is converted to text by the Speech Recognizer.
2. The NLP Engine processes the text to extract intent and context.
3. The Intent Detector routes the command to the appropriate module.
4. Execution Modules perform the task (e.g., launching an app, toggling a light, or analyzing a screenshot).
5. The TTS module delivers a spoken response, with optional visual feedback via a GUI.

## üîç How It Works

JARVIS processes commands in a streamlined, multi-step pipeline:

1. **Voice Input**: The user speaks a command, captured by the microphone and converted to text via `SpeechRecognition`.
2. **Intent Analysis**: The text is processed by Cohere Command R+ (or a local NLP model) to determine the user‚Äôs intent.
3. **Action Routing**: The Intent Detector selects the appropriate module (e.g., automation, vision, or hardware control).
4. **Task Execution**:
   - Software tasks (e.g., app launch) use Windows APIs or `pyautogui`.
   - Hardware tasks send signals to Arduino via `pySerial`.
   - Vision tasks process camera or screen input with llama-3-2-11b.
5. **Response Delivery**: The TTS module generates a spoken response, with optional GUI or visual feedback.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Control
For AC appliance control, JARVIS interfaces with an Arduino, which uses optocouplers and TRIACs to safely switch high-voltage devices. The circuit design ensures electrical isolation for user safety.

### üñ•Ô∏è Vision Processing
The vision module captures live screen or camera input, processes it with llama-3-2-11b for tasks like object detection or text extraction. Example: "Analyze my screen" triggers a screenshot and content description.
